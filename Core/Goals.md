##1. What Is A Goal?

*Ref: /Library/Goal*

A **goal** is something that can be achieved during a conflict above and beyond just beating up the other characters involved. There may be any number of goals, depending on the situation. Available goals should written down somewhere where they are visible to all players. Using index cards for each goal or a central sheet of paper listing all goals both work.

The effects, or lack thereof, of a goal is purely mechanical. A character may well desire a goal to be completed for entirely personal or narrative reasons.

The key to getting the most out of your *Mecha Prime* experience lies in mastering the use of goals.

*Ref: /Library/Action*

Name
:	Achieve Goal

Investment
:	Strike: [1] to [6]

Effect
:	Successes rolled on a Achieve Goal action are compared against the difficulty rating of the goal. If the actor has accumulated equal or greater number of successes as the goal's difficulty, the goal has been **achieved**. If the number of successes is less than the goal's difficulty, the roll is a failure.
