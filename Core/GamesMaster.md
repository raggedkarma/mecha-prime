###2.1 Group Characters
In conflict scenes, the GM may designate a group of her characters either a *squad* or *swarm*. This group will now operate as a single character for the entire conflict. This is both to aid in managing protracted combats against many opponents, and also to allow for minor or inconsequential characters to become a threat to the player characters through sheer weight of numbers or tactical capability.
