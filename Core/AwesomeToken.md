##1. Earning Awesome Tokens

###1.1 Manoeuvre Action Update
During a manoeuvre, any character or adversity which earns five or more pool dice at once, is awarded an Awesome Token.

###1.2 GM Award
The GM may award Awesome Tokens for interesting manoeuvre descriptions. If the character should qualify for an Awesome Token award, they may only receive one.

##2. Spending Awesome Tokens

For **one** Token, a character may make a free action *except a manoeuvre*, even if they have already acted this turn. It may also may be used to *Catch Your Breath*. This free action may be taken at any time, even between other characters' actions.

>Awesome Tokens cannot be used to take a free manoeuvre action (forgetting this exception leads to a breakdown of the system, so make sure to remember it).

For **two** Tokens, a character may take damage on behalf of another. This only applies once damage is determined, and so differences in defense values have no effect.

For **three** Tokens, a strike action may be applied against two targets simultaneously. The attacker must designate both targets and roll their strike pool once. The strike pool is treated as normal in all respects, and applies successes against both targets. If some of your dice only work against certain types of adversity and youâ€™re using the tokens to strike against different types, make a separate roll for the type-specific dice.
