##2. Conflict Scenes

During a conflict, both the GM and the Party take turns. A round is finished once both sides have completed their turn, and a new round begins. The GM has the final decision which side begins the conflict, and when the conflict scene is over.

Within their turn each character may take an action, in any order. During the Party's turn, the players may decide amongst themselves in which order their characters perform an action. The GM is free to decide in her turn the order of her character's actions. A character or adversity only has one action per round by default.

All game actions of mechanical importance use a number of six-sided dice, referred to as an *action* or *roll*. A character has contextual access to a number of collections of dice, or *pools*, which are used to construct rolls.

> Every die with a result of three or greater is a success.

###2.1 Pools
The size of a pool changes over the course of the game. If dice are committed from a pool for a roll, the success of the roll determines what happens to the dice:

>**If the roll is a success**, the dice are discarded, effectively reducing dice from the pool.

>**If the roll is a failure**, the committed dice are returned to the pool.

####2.1.1 Action
A character has a pool of dice representing their stamina, drive and current level of physical and mental exhaustion.

This pool defaults to being at capacity of 10, and is depleted through conflict, and replenished primarily outside of it.

####2.1.2 Strike
This represents the moment of truth for a character. That tipping point in any conflict where victory can be seized.

This pool is defaults to being empty, with various actions taken by a character allowing them to increase the number of dice in this pool.

###2.2 Actions
The following actions are available to all conflict participants, but nearly all have basic pool requirements which is indicated under the name of the action. This is the required number of dice that must be invested from the actor's pool, to the maximum presented. If a character does not have enough dice in the particular pool, they may not use that action.

####2.2.1 Manoeuvre
*Action Pool: [1] to [3]*
These are dramatic actions which nudge the conflict closer to the acting character's intentions. The actor has nearly complete narrative freedom to describe the characters actions taken, from nervouse firefights to thunderous oratory. It is recommended that players leverage this freedom to describe interesting, compelling descriptions.

Each success rolled on a Manoeuvre action will create a *Strike* die, which is added to the character's *Strike* pool, to a maximum of five. If no successes are rolled, the roll is considered a failure.

#####2.2.1.1 Combined Manoeuvres


####2.2.2 Attack
*Strike Pool: [1] to [6]*
Successes rolled on an Attack action are compared to the defense of the target. A wound is inflicted if the number of successes is equal to or greater than the target's defense. Should the number of successes be equal to or greater than a multiple of the target's defense, the attack inflicts multiple wounds.

If the number of success is less than the target's defense, the roll is a failure.

####2.2.3 Catch Your Breath
*No requirement*
This action represents the character making time to recover their wits, possibly hunker down to discuss strategy or similar restorative action. The character may return up to two dice back to their Action Pool.

These dice are added at the end of the turn, after every other effect.

##3. Narrative

//Always have narrative control. Can't die.
