##2. Conflict Scenes
A conflict is a mechanical approximation of any demanding sequence of events with a notable outcome. The most recognisable form of conflict is a violent confrontation, or combat conflict, but anything which can tire out the participants and may provide long-term consequence applies.

During a conflict, both the GM and the Party take turns. A round is finished once both sides have completed their turn, and a new round begins. The GM has the final decision which side begins the conflict, and when the conflict scene is over.

Within their turn each character may take an action, in any order. During the Party's turn, the players may decide amongst themselves in which order their characters perform an action. The GM is free to decide in her turn the order of her character's actions. A character or adversity only has one action per round by default.

All game actions of mechanical importance use a number of six-sided dice, referred to as an *action* or *roll*. A character has contextual access to a number of collections of dice, or *pools*. All rolls are built with dice drawn from one or more pools.

*Ref: /Library/Action*

> Every die with a result of three or greater is a success.

###2.1 Pools
The size of a pool changes over the course of the game. If dice are committed from a pool for a roll, the success of the roll determines what happens to those dice:

>**If the roll is a success**, the dice are discarded, removing them from their pool.

>**If the roll is a failure**, the committed dice are returned to the pool.

####2.1.1 Action
A character has a pool of dice representing their stamina, drive and current level of physical and mental exhaustion.

This pool defaults to being at capacity of 10, and is depleted through conflict, but replenishes over time. Conflict action rolls must draw at least one die from the Action pool.

####2.1.2 Strike
This represents the tipping point in any conflict where victory can be seized.

This pool is resets to empty, with various character actions increasing the number of dice in this pool.

####2.2 Ranges
While it specifically relevant only to combat conflicts, the distance between combatants begins to apply. There are only three broad *Ranges* to a combat:

Close Quarters (CQ)
:	This is incredibly close, up to a few metres. The range of a punch or very crude firearms.

Firefight (FF)
:	The majority of combat takes place at this range, and so the majority of weapons are effective within this distance.

Extreme (EX)
:	The furthest shots that can be taken, often remote-targetted.

###2.3 Actions
*Ref: /Library/Action*

Name
:	Manoeuvre

Investment
:	Action: [1] to [3]

Effect
:	These are dramatic actions which nudge the conflict closer to the acting character's intentions. The actor has nearly complete narrative freedom to describe the characters actions taken, from nervouse firefights to thunderous oratory. It is recommended that players leverage this freedom to describe interesting, compelling descriptions.
	
	When nominating a target, the actor must possess a weapon or item which allows them to affect their opponent at that range. Otherwise, they must use their manoeuvre description to close or further the range to their desired target.
	
	Irrespective of narration, every success rolled on a Manoeuvre action will create a *Strike* die, which is added to the character's *Strike* pool, to a maximum of five. If no successes are rolled, the roll is considered a failure.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Name
:	Attack

Investment
:	Strike: [1] to [6]

Effect
:	Successes rolled on an Attack action are compared to the defense of the target. A wound is inflicted if the number of successes is equal to or greater than the target's defense. Should the number of successes be equal to or greater than a multiple of the target's defense, the attack inflicts multiple wounds.

	If the number of success is less than the target's defense, the roll is a failure.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name
:	Catch Your Breath

Investment
: *None*

Effect
:	This action represents the character making time to recover their wits, possibly hunker down to discuss strategy or similar restorative action. The character may return up to two dice back to their Action Pool.

	These dice are added at the end of the turn, after every other effect.
