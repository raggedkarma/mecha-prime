##1. What Is A Mech?
//20+ tons of awesome

##2. Overdrive

A mech is capable of being pushed further than the manufacturers would prefer, and they place hard limiters to safguard against reckless piloting. Any pilot worth his salt will deactivate or even rip out such safeguards, making their mech respond faster, cycle ammunition quicker and allow for deeper OS access. However, a pilot must be careful not to overtax his mech, or he may cross the flashpoint, and start causing damage as systems overheat, glitch, and possibly lead to catastrophic failures.

###2.1 Overdrive Pool
All mecha have an additional pool referred to as an *Overdrive* pool. Dice in this pool may be spent to push their mech's systems to greater effect, as specified in the system details.

This pool is defaults to being empty, with various actions taken by a character allowing them to increase the number of dice in this pool.

###2.2 Ghost

While a mech's systems are all stringently	tested, they are still controlled in the field by merging a pilot's autonomic functions with hastily-written software. Obvious, aberrant behaviour is immediately rooted out and patched where possible, but pilots learn to recognise their mech's tics and traits, and refer to them as its ghost.

>A ghost provides opportunities outside of manoeuvres to earn *Overdrive* dice.

A character must select a ghost for each mech when they pilot it. A different pilot may find the mech to possess a different ghost, for it is as much a reflection of the pilot's inner self as it is bugs in the code. This may be swapped out for another during periods of downtime, where patches may be applied or whole subsystems even manually reset or replaced.

While the pilot himself isn't affected by a ghost, it is fed by them to some extent. Without them it wouldn't manifest, which might suggest a hidden desire or ambition. Many pilots also prefer piloting those mecha with compatible ghosts.

####2.2.1 How To Read A Ghost
A ghost is presented with a **name**, **description**, and **trigger** and **reward**. Should the condition described in the trigger be met, the benefit detailed in the reward is immediately recouped. Usually this is in the form of an *Overdrive* die placed directly in the *Overdrive* pool.

###2.3 Mech Manoeuvre Action
*Action Pool [1] to [3]*

A mech may use their embedded systems to gain bonus dice, depending on the target. **Library Ref: ./System**

Each success rolled on a Mech Manoeuvre action, except sixes, will create a *Strike* die as default, which is added to the character's *Strike* pool. Every success die of six creates an *Overdrive* die, which is added to the *Overdrive* pool. The maximum number of dice created for pools from a manoeuvre is limited to a maximum of five, though should more successes be rolled the actor may choose which dice pool is increased. If no successes are rolled, the roll is considered a failure.

This replaces the default manoeuvre action for mecha.

###2.4 Overheat
If the Overdrive pool for a character is equal to or greater than the the Flashpoint rating of the character's chassis, such dice are qualified as *Overheat* dice. They are still considered part of the *Overdrive* pool, and may be spent as *Overdrive* dice.

If a mech suffers any amount of damage in combat, any *Overheat* dice are rolled, but not spent from the pool. For each success, a mech system is taken **offline**. The pilot may select which systems are offline. If the success is a six, in addition to the system going offline (and the initial damage to the mech), the pilot suffers a wound.

##3. How To Read A Mech Chassis

A mech will be presented with the following information: general **statistics**, including flashpoint, **sockets** grouped by type, and a quick recount of its **history**, including any famous examples. Some mecha are presented with a wireframe diagram, indicating the location of each socket, to help players to better envision their mecha.

###3.1 Statistics
Every chassis details a basic roster of information, including: name, model number, flashpoint and armour ratings, original manufacture date, base height and weight, and approximate purchase price (new).

####3.1.1 Flashpoint
The flashpoint rating determines the point from which *Overdrive* dice are considered *Overheating* dice in the *Overdrive* pool.

####3.1.2 Armour
The armour rating of a mech is the defense rating used against all *Attack* actions.

####3.1.3 Structure
The structure rating is the number of wounds a mech can take before being broken.

###3.2 Sockets
Sockets may be listed as a quick grouping of numbers by type, or a full locational diagram detailing the location and type of each socket.

####3.2.1 **Library Ref: ./System**
A socket allows the mech owner to embed a **system** of equal type.

###3.3 History
Each chassis was originally designed to meet a specific need, usually with an intended loadout. This was usually iteratively updated and refined over time, leading to the current chassis. Some are the products of famous inventors or wars, but all have a history, which is detailed here.

##4. How To Build A Mech

A player selecting a mech must first select a chassis, which will indicate the number and type of available sockets. The player must then select the appropriately-typed systems to embed until all available sockets are used. 

The player must select a ghost for his character and mech, at any point in the process.

Finally, the new mech should be given a name.

Once complete, all details regarding the new mech should be recorded alongside the player's character information.
