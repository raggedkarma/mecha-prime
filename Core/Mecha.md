##1. What Is A Mech?
//Well, what is it then?

##2. Overdrive

A mech is capable of being pushed further than the manufacturers and pit crew would prefer, and hard limiters are in place to safguard against reckless piloting. Any pilot worth his salt will deactivate or even rip out such safeguards, making their mech respond faster, cycle ammunition quicker and allow their subconsciousness deeper OS access. However, a pilot must be careful not to overtax his mech, or he may cross the flashpoint, and start causing damage as systems overheat, glitch, and possibly lead to catastrophic failures.

###2.1 Overdrive Pool
All mecha have an additional pool referred to as an *Overdrive* pool. Dice in this pool may be spent to push their mech's systems to greater effect, as specified in the system details.

This pool is defaults to being empty, with various actions taken by a character allowing them to increase the number of dice in this pool.

###2.2 Ghost
> Ref: /Library/Mech/Ghost

While a mech's systems are all stringently	tested, they are still controlled in the field by merging a pilot's autonomic functions with hastily-written software. Obvious, aberrant behaviour is immediately rooted out and patched where possible, but pilots learn to recognise their mech's tics and traits, and refer to them as its ghost.

A ghost provides opportunities outside of manoeuvres to earn *Overdrive* dice.

A character must select a ghost for each mech when they pilot it. A different pilot may find the mech to possess a different ghost, for it is as much a reflection of the pilot's inner self as it is bugs in the code. This may be swapped out for another during periods of downtime, where patches may be applied or whole subsystems even manually reset or replaced.

While the pilot himself isn't affected by a ghost, it is fed by them to some extent. Without them it wouldn't manifest, which might suggest a hidden desire or ambition. Many pilots also prefer piloting those mecha with compatible ghosts.

###2.3 Mech Manoeuvre Action
*Action Pool [1] to [3]*

> Ref: /Library/Mecha/Weapon

A mech may use their embedded weapons to gain bonus dice, depending on the target type. Notably, every weapon in range may contribute their available bonus dice to a manoeuvre.

Each success rolled on a Mech Manoeuvre action, except sixes, will create a *Strike* die as default, which is added to the character's *Strike* pool. Every success die of six creates an *Overdrive* die, which is added to the *Overdrive* pool. The maximum number of dice created for pools from a manoeuvre is limited to a maximum of five, though should more successes be rolled the actor may choose which dice pool is increased. If no successes are rolled, the roll is considered a failure.

This replaces the default manoeuvre action for mecha.

###2.4 Overheat
If the Overdrive pool for a character is equal to or greater than the the Flashpoint rating of the character's chassis, such dice are qualified as *Overheat* dice. They are still considered part of the *Overdrive* pool, and may be spent as *Overdrive* dice.

If a mech suffers any amount of damage in combat, any *Overheat* dice are rolled, but not spent from the pool. For each success, a mech system is taken **offline**. The pilot may select which systems are offline. If the success is a six, in addition to the system going offline (and the initial damage to the mech), the pilot suffers a wound.

##3. How To Build A Mech
>Ref: Library/Mech/*

A player selecting a mech must first select a chassis, which will indicate the number and type of available sockets. The player must then select the appropriately-typed systems to embed until all available sockets are used.

The player must select a ghost for his character and mech, at any point in the process.

Finally, the new mech should be given a name.

Once complete, all details regarding the new mech should be recorded alongside the player's character information.
