A fast-paced mecha tabletop roleplaying game, intended to be built as a living rulebook. In aid of this, I have taken leave of my senses and built out the system particulars into a Model-View-Controller equivalent.

##Navigating The Crazy
Various game aspects are broken into their own sections, the intended scope of each is detailed below.

Also note that this RPG document arrangement requires the following:

All files use [MarkDown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown), and have the **.md** extension;

Files may refer to other files using a file path (without extension) in the following manner:

>Ref /Library/Example

###Core
The Core folder contains files detailing how to play and run the game, and build characters and mecha. Note that the Core uses plural file names, except for the base Core file.

###Library
The Library contains files detailing unique items. Note that the Library exclusively uses singlular file names.

Stat blocks, weapon descriptions, and the like are not actually listed here, but the tools to interpret such for game use are.

###Setting
While I envision this folder being named after the setting itself, for this game I will resolve to name it, simply, Setting.

The Setting files will naturally include geographic and historic detail, allowing both players and GM be acquainted with the setting. This section will also provide Library items interpreted for the setting.
