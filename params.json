Anima Prime\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA fast-paced mecha tabletop roleplaying game, intended to be built as a living rulebook. In aid of this, I have taken leave of my senses and built out the system particulars into a Model-View-Controller equivalent.\r\n\r\n##Navigating The Crazy\r\nVarious game aspects are broken into their own sections, the intended scope of each is detailed below.\r\n\r\nAlso note that this RPG document arrangement requires the following:\r\n\r\nAll files use [MarkDown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown), and have the **.md** extension;\r\n\r\nFiles may refer to other files using a file path (without extension) in the following manner:\r\n\r\n>Ref /Library/Example\r\n\r\n###Core\r\nThe Core folder contains files detailing how to play and run the game, and build characters and mecha. Note that the Core uses plural file names, except for the base Core file.\r\n\r\n###Library\r\nThe Library contains files detailing unique items. Note that the Library exclusively uses singlular file names.\r\n\r\nStat blocks, weapon descriptions, and the like are not actually listed here, but the tools to interpret such for game use are.\r\n\r\n###Setting\r\nWhile I envision this folder being named after the setting itself, for this game I will resolve to name it, simply, Setting.\r\n\r\nThe Setting files will naturally include geographic and historic detail, allowing both players and GM be acquainted with the setting. This section will also provide Library items interpreted for the setting.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n##Anima Prime\r\nThe original game system, **Anime Prime**, is licensed under Creative Commons, and available at www.AnimaPrimeRPG.com for free. If you are a fan of *The Last Airbender* TV series or *Final Fantasy* video games, you should definitely check it out!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
