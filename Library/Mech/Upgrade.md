##1. What is a System?

There are two types of systems, **weapons** and **upgrades**.

##2. How To Read A System

##3. How To Read A Weapon
A weapon is a type of system, and so will detail name, type, statistics, offline, function and history. However, a weapon's function is further detailed as a **firepower** breakdown, and anywhere from one to five **overdrive abilities**.

###3.1 Firepower (Manoeuvre Bonus)
Every weapon system will provide bonus dice for manoeuvres which describe their use. A weapon will indicate in its firepower breakdown the number of bonus dice provided depending on target grouping type (*solo*, *squad* or *swarm*).

###3.2 Overdrive Abilities
A weapon system may detail an *Overdrive Ability*, which is a special effect that may be used by spending dice from the *Overdrive* pool.

>Any *Overheating* dice spent must be rolled immediately: on a six a system goes offline.

####3.2.1 How To Read An Overdrive Ability
An *Overdrive Ability* will list: **name**, **keywords**, the *Overdrive* **cost**, and **effect**.

####3.2.1.1 Name
The name of the ability, either shouted aloud when employed by the pilot, or simply a short-hand between players.

####3.2.1.2 Keywords
The following keywords impact on when the ability may be employed, and against whom.

**Action:** This ability requires an action to perform.

**|Action Type|:** This ability may only be used in addition to an action of the same type.

**|Weapon Type|:** Any damage from this ability is also considered entirely of the given type.

####3.2.1.3 Cost
The cost of the ability in *Overdrive*. Any dice spent to pay for this ability are lost, even if any action roll made by the character this round is a failure.

####3.2.1.4 Effect
The effect text determines how the ability will embolden the character's allies and bring ruin to his enemies.
