Goal
====


Name
:	The name of the goal. This is might be a purely pragmatic description of the mechanical function of the goal, or intentionally open to interpretation.

Difficulty
:	The difficulty rating of a goal will range from 4 (Easy) to 10 (Heroic).

Scope
:	A goal's scope will indicate which characters are capable of achieving it. By default, a goal is *open*, which means that any character may attept it. If the scope of a goal is not listed, it is assumed to be open.

State
:	At any time, a goal may be *active*, *resolved*. A goal is created in the *active* state, and then enters the *resolved* state once it has been achieved. A goal will indicate if it has any effects which are applied while it is either *active* or *resolved*. Once resolved, the goal may indicate that it should be *dismissed*, which means it is removed from the game. Note the previously applied effects of the dismissed goal remain, however.


##Notes
1. Goals are a fundamental aspect of the game. It is encouraged for everyone to read up on them.
