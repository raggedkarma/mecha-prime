##1. What Is A Goal?

A **goal** is something that can be achieved during a conflict above and beyond just beating up the other characters involved. There may be any number of goals, depending on the situation. Available goals should written down somewhere where they are visible to all players. Using index cards for each goal or a central sheet of paper listing all goals both work.

The key to getting the most out of your *Mecha Prime* experience lies in mastering the use of goals.

##2. How To Read A Goal

A goal is presented with a **name**, **difficulty rating**, **scope**, and **states**.

##2.1 Name
The name of the goal. This is might be a purely pragmatic description of the mechanical function of the goal, or intentionally open to interpretation.

##2.2 Difficulty
The difficulty rating of a goal will range from 4 (Easy) to 10 (Heroic).

###2.3 Scope
A goal's scope will indicate which characters are capable of achieving it. By default, a goal is *open*, which means that any character may attept it. If the scope of a goal is not listed, it is assumed to be open.

###2.4 States
At any time, a goal may be *active*, *resolved*. A goal is created in the *active* state, and then enters the *resolved* state once it has been achieved. A goal will indicate if it has any effects which are applied while it is either *active* or *resolved*. Once resolved, the goal may indicate that it should be *dismissed*, which means it is removed from the game. Note the previously applied effects of the dismissed goal remain, however.

The effects, or lack thereof, of a goal is purely mechanical. A character may well desire a goal to be completed for entirely personal or narrative reasons.

##3 New Action

The following conflict action is available whenever a goal is in play:

####3.1 Achieve Goal
*Strike Pool: [1] to [6]*
Successes rolled on a Achieve Goal action are compared against the difficulty rating of the goal. If the actor has accumulated equal or greater number of successes as the goal's difficulty, the goal has been **achieved**. If the number of successes is less than the goal's difficulty, the roll is a failure.
