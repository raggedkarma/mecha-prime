##1. What Is A Condition?
A condition is an effect that represents certain circumstances, such as personal or environmental advantages or hindrances.
If a condition should have an effect on a characterâ€™s dice pool, only apply it once per turn, even if that character takes additional actions with *Awesome Tokens*.

##2. How To Read A Condition
A condition is identified by its effect scope: individual or overarching. Attempts to counter a condition must take the effect scope into account.

By default, a condition has an **individual** effect. This means that they affect a single character.

An **overarching** condition affects multiple characters, usually everyone within a designated area.
